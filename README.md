## What's OpenRecorder?
OpenRecorder is an open-source, smooth and intuitive screen recorder. It's very customizable and it has many features that no other recorders have. We support all video platforms and all Windows versions. OpenRecorder can be used on **other Operating Systems as well**, but you will need a software that runs Windows Apps. ex: **Wine for Linux**.

## Why OpenRecorder?

**OpenRecorder** is a little different from other screen recording programs, it offers the best features it can to its users, with unlimited customizability. Unlike other recorders, we also offer built-in apps that make it easy to communicate with your viewers. Apps we currently provide: OpenNote, OpenPaint, OpenBrowser. In the future, we plan on creating more built-in apps like a Video editor/Thumbnail creator, etc...
